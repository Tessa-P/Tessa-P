Hello!  I'm Tessa P, a Mechanical Engineering student in Ontario, Canada.  Broadly, this will be where I put particular interesting projects or completed scripts, 
particularly as I try to simulate games and create programs that can find optimal strategies for those games.  If you have any questions, I'm available at tessapugh10@gmail.com
